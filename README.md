# LBYL_vs_EAFP
LBYL vs EAFP

**Language: Pascal**

**Start: 2024**

## Why
I wanted to test the two paradigms:

- EAFP - Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission
- LBYL - Look Before You Leap

and the context of a simple division by 0 in a Pascal program.

The results don't show a major difference between the two tests:

```
----- EAFP - Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission
Total time: 91.12 s
Avg. time: 911.22 ms
----- LBYL - Look Before You Leap
Total time: 91.38 s
Avg. time: 913.79 ms
